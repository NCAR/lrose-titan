Building netCDF - HOWTO
=======================

To build the latest release of netCDF (4.0), you optionally can include
support for HDF5, in which case you also need the udunits2 package.

Downloading:
------------

  netcdf: http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/downloads/netcdf/

  udunits2: http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/downloads/udunits

  hdf5: http://www.hdfgroup.org/HDF5/release

Building HDF5:
--------------

Put this in /usr/local

  tar xvfz hdf5-1.8.2.tar.gz
  cd hdf5-1.8.2
  ./configure --prefix=/usr/local
  make 
  make check
  make install
  make clean

Building udunits2:
------------------

Put this in /usr/local

  cd udunits-2.1.5
  ./configure --prefix=/usr/local
  make
  make check
  make install
  make install-info install-html install-pdf
  make clean

Building netcdf
---------------

It is recommended that you do 2 builds, one netcdf3 vanilla (without HDF5 support)
and one with full netCDF4 and HDF5 support.

  cd netcdf-4.0
  FC=gfortran
  export FC

  ./configure --enable-netcdf-4 --with-hdf5=/usr/local --prefix=/usr/local/netcdf4
  make
  make check
  make install
  make clean

  ./configure --prefix=/usr/local
  make
  make check
  make install
  make clean
