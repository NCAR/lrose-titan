Configuring a host
==================

NOTE: before running configure_host, you must stop the system:

  stop_all

To configure a host, after checking out the system into the ~/cvs directory,
or copying this across to another host:

  cd ~/cvs/projects/titan/cp2/projDir/system/scripts
  ./configure_host
  source ~/.cshrc

Then, you can restart the host:

  start_all
