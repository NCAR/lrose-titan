CASE ANALYSIS
=============

Introduction.
-------------

The document details the use of the case analysis software which was
added to TITAN during November/December 1997. The intention of this
software is to provide the statistical analysis capabilities provided
by the original storm tracking software used on the South African
projects. The funding for the new TITAN software comes from the
Mexican PARC project.

Definition of a case.
---------------------

For each case there exists a corresponding 'experimental unit.'

The experimental unit is defined as the storm as measured by the radar
and tracked by TITAN, using a set threshold, for the time period 'x'
min prior to decision time to 'y' min after decision time. If
the storm does not exist 'x' min before decision time, the case
starts at the first detection by TITAN. Similarly if the storms dies
before 'y' min after decision time the case ends when TITAN no
longer detects it.

Any mergers and splits which occur during the specified time period
will be included in the analysis, but any mergers and splits which
occur outside that time period will be ignored.

Identifying a case.
-------------------

The rview and time_hist displays are the main tools for identifying
cases. It is assumed that the radar data, TITAN tracks and aircraft
tracks are available for each case.

Use rview to find the case at decision time, using the TITAN tracks
and the aircraft position. Set the annotation to 'track numbers'. Note
the complex and simple track number. The track number appears either
as a single number or as a pair, such as 129/277. If there is only a
single number the complex and simple track numbers are the same. If
there is a pair, the complex number is the first of the pair and the
simple number is the second.

Middle double-clicking on the case at decision time will give you an
idea of what the case looks like. time_hist includes the following
parameters:

  time_hist.partial_track_past_period: 20.0
  time_hist.partial_track_future_period: 60.0

If set as above, middle-clicking the case will highlight the
case from  20 minutes before to 60 minutes after the current
time on the display. Middle-clicking on the track menu button
will turn off all other tracks, leaving only the case.

Creating the case_tracks file.
------------------------------

Create an ASCII file which contains the details of all of the
cases. The file 'case_tracks.example' is an example of such a file.
The headers in the file are self-explanatory.

Comments start with '#'.

The following are the columns you need to fill in:

case   Seed?   N.    Seed   track ref time        Ref-   End-  (cont.)
num    Y/N     of    Dur    YYYY MM DD HH MM SS   start  ref   (cont.)
               Flrs  (min)                        (min)  (min) (cont.)
----   -----   ----  -----  -------------------   -----  ----- (cont.)

 Compl Simpl Cloud Mixing  CCL    L.I.
 track track Base  Ratio   Temp   500mb
   num   num   (km)  (g/kg)  (C)    (C)
 ----- ----- ----- ------  ----   ------

'track ref time' and 'decision time' are synonymous.

Ref-start is the time (in min) from the desired start of the case to
decision time. End-ref is the time from decision time to the the
desired end of the case.

Only include cases for which a TITAN track was found.

Check the file 'case_tracks.example' to see how this was done for Mexico.
Those cases for which no TITAN tracks existed are commented out.

The environmental data (cloud base, mixing ration, CCL temp or lifted
index) is included for partitioning purposes in the analysis. For
example, you may choose to only include cases for which cloud base is
in a given range. If any of the environmental data is not available
use -999.0 to indicate a missing value.

Dealing with bad mergers.
-------------------------

If you feel that the track includes parts of the storm which are
not relevant to the case, limit the duration of the case by setting
'Ref-start' and 'End-ref' accordingly.

Checking the case definitions.
------------------------------

rview and time_hist have been updated to identify cases from a case file.
This allows you to check exactly which portions of a storm are included in
a case.

In the time_hist parameter file, set:

  time_hist.use_case_tracks: true
  time_hist.case_tracks_file_path: $(TITAN_HOME)/params/???????

Then, when you click on a case in rview, using the middle button, the
case number will be displayed on both rview and time_hist instead of
the track number. For example, case 15 will appear as C15. To see the
track number as before, use the left button (complex track) or right
button (simple track).

Check all of the cases using rview and time_hist. The time-history
window (upper-right) has been updated to allow all of the storm
properties to be viewed at once. The time-height window (middle-right)
has been updated to optionally show the max reflectivity plotted on
the vertical centroid. Check the help feature for details on these
changes.

Computing track properties - PartialProps.
------------------------------------------

Replaces old TRACKPROPS program.

Track properties are computed for the cases by running the program
PartialProps. Check the parameter file for parameter details. Apart
from the various directory names, the main parameter is the
'altitude_threshold', which is the altitude cutoff for computing the
volume_above_alt and mass_above_alt properties.

You need to create a directory (usually called case_props or
something similar) for the case properties.

For each case PartialProps will create a global properties and a time
series properties file. For example, for case 17, the files would be
global.017 and tseries.017. These files are ASCII, and the data from
them is used by the next step, CaseStats. The time series files have
one data line for each scan in the case. The delta times are relative
to decision time. See CaseStats for generating interpolated
time series files.

Take a look at the files to see which properties are computed.  'roi'
means 'rate of increase'. 'ht_max_minus_centroid_z' is 'ht_of_dbz_max'
minus 'refl_centroid_z'. VCDI is the Vertical Centroid Difference
Integral, which is ht_max_minus_centroid_z integrated over time.

Case Statistics - CaseStats.
----------------------------

Replaces old RANDOM_STATS program.

CaseStats runs on the property files produced by PartialProps. It
produces statistics on differences between the the seed and no-seed
cases. Optionally you can run the re-randomization option to produce
P-factors.

CaseStats uses the case_tracks file and the files stored in the
case_props directory.

In the parameter file you indicate which global and time series
properties you want to analyze. For the time series you also indicate
the times, relative to decision time, at which you wish to analyze the
series. If you use the -interp command line option, the interpolated
time series data is written out to the case_props directory in the
same format as the raw time series data. This may be useful should you
wish to perform other analyses or plot the data.

You may also specify conditions to be placed on the analysis. For example,
setting:

  conditions = {
    {	
      "volume@0", /* prop_name:string */
      0.0, /* min_val:double */
      750.0 /* max_val:double */
    }
  };

only includes cases with volumes at time 0 (decision time) between 0
and 750 km3. The '@' in the property name indicates a time series
property at a number of minutes relative to decision time. If no '@'
exists in the property name it is assumed to be a global property.

You may perform the analysis on the following statistics:

  arithmetic means  : use -arith  on command line
  geometric  means  : use -geom   on command line
  first  quartiles  : use -quart1 on command line
  second quartiles  : use -quart2 on command line
  third  quartiles  : use -quart3 on command line

These options may also be specified directly in the parameter file.

You may specify whether or not to use rerandomization. If set,
the number in the list and the worst split are also specified.

Output from CaseStats is in ASCII to stdout. You can redirect to
a file.
