<h1>Cloud seeding analysis using TITAN</h1>

<p>
The rain-enhancement experiment was randomized, i.e. some storms were seeded and others not seeded on a random basis. Aircraft position relative to the treated storms was determined in those pre-GPS days by transponder returns from the seeding aircraft. TITAN version 1.0 was successfully used to identify and track the experimental storms. A statistical comparison of the storm properties between the seeded and un-seeded storms was used to evaluate the seeding effects. Sine the experiment was randomized, a re-randomization technique could be used for the evaluation. According to the re-randomization theory, the original split between seeded and un-seeded storms is one possible outcome from a large number of possible random outcomes. The actual seeded vs. un-seeded split is used to compute the seeding effect - using radar-estimated rainfall as an example. This postulated seeding effect is then compared to the 'effect' which would have occurred in a large number (say 10000) other random splits. The probability of the seeding effect being the result of chance is computed from the position of the experimental result in the ranking of the 10000 pseudo-results.
